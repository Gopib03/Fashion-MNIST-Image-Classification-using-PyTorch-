# Fashion-MNIST Image Classification using PyTorch

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for classifying images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset using **pure PyTorch**.  
It is designed as an **entry-level deep learning project** for beginners.

## Features
- Pure PyTorch implementation
- CNN model with dropout for regularization
- GPU acceleration support (Colab / CUDA / torch.accelerator)
- Training and evaluation loop included
- Visual predictions with matplotlib
- Achieves ~91% test accuracy
- 
## Dataset
Fashion-MNIST contains 70,000 grayscale images of size 28×28 across 10 classes:

- T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot

Project Overview 
Fashion-MNIST Image Classification using PyTorch

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification on the Fashion-MNIST dataset using pure PyTorch.
It is designed as an entry-level deep learning project, suitable for students and learners who want to understand:

how to load datasets in PyTorch
how to build custom CNN models
how to train and evaluate models
how to use GPU acceleration (CUDA / torch.accelerator)
how to visualize predictions
